POP Buffer Demo
===============

This is a sample implementation for the POP Buffer introduced by the team of X3DOM in 2013. It consists of a simple WebGL renderer and a small writing component that creates POP Buffer binaries from obj files.

Attention: This is currently **Work in Progress**. The implementation currently **does not fullfill the specification of the pop buffer**.
